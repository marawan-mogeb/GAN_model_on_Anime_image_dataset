# GAN Model on Anime Image Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate anime-style images. By leveraging a dataset of anime images, the model learns to create realistic and visually appealing outputs that resemble the styles and patterns of the original dataset.

## Features
- Trains a GAN architecture with a generator and discriminator.
- Utilizes an anime image dataset for training.
- Outputs synthetic anime images that closely resemble the original dataset.
- Includes code for preprocessing, training, and visualization of results.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- GPU for faster training (optional but recommended)

### Required Libraries
Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Dependencies include:**
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

## Dataset
This project uses an anime image dataset from kaggle `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset/data`. 
Ensure you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

### Dataset Structure
```

```

You can use publicly available anime datasets or any other relevant dataset of your choice.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marawan-mogeb/GAN_model_on_Anime_image_dataset
   ```

2. Place the anime image dataset in the `dataset` folder.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GAN_model_on_Anime_image_dataset.ipynb
   ```

4. Use the provided trained weights file (`gan_model_epoch-150.weights.h5`) to skip training and directly generate images. Place the file in the project directory.

5. Modify the notebook to load the weights:
   ```python
   generator.load_weights('gan_model_epoch-150.weights.h5')
   ```

6. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Generate images using the pre-trained model.

7. View the results in the output folder or as displayed in the notebook.

## Key Sections in the Notebook
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Resizes and normalizes images to prepare for training.
   ```python
   def preprocess_data(image):
       image = tf.image.resize(image, (64, 64))
       image = (image - 127.5) / 127.5  # Normalize to [-1, 1]
       return image
   ```

2. **Model Architecture**: Implements the generator and discriminator.
   Generator example:
   ```python
   def build_generator():
       model = tf.keras.Sequential([
           tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_dim=100),
           tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
           tf.keras.layers.LeakyReLU(),
           tf.keras.layers.Reshape((16, 16, 1)),
           tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, kernel_size=4, strides=2, padding='same', activation='tanh')
       ])
       return model
   ```

3. **Training**: Includes the training loop and loss calculations.
   ```python
   for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
       for real_images in dataset:
           noise = tf.random.normal([BATCH_SIZE, NOISE_DIM])
           generated_images = generator(noise, training=True)
           
           # Discriminator and generator training steps
           train_discriminator(real_images, generated_images)
           train_generator(noise)
   ```

4. **Visualization**: Displays generated images during and after training.
   ```python
   def display_images(epoch, generator, noise_dim):
       noise = tf.random.normal([16, noise_dim])
       generated_images = generator(noise, training=False)
       plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
       for i in range(16):
           plt.subplot(4, 4, i + 1)
           plt.imshow((generated_images[i] * 127.5 + 127.5).astype('uint8'))
           plt.axis('off')
       plt.show()
   ```

## Outputs
The GAN generates anime-style images, which are saved periodically during training for evaluation.

### Sample Outputs (After Loading Trained Weights)
Below are some sample outputs generated by the model after loading the provided weights (`gan_model_epoch-150.weights.h5`):
